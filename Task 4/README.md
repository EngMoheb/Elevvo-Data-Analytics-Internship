# 🗂️ Data Cleaning & Preparation Project – Kaggle Data Science & ML Survey

## 📖 Project Story – Before the Cleaning Began

### 1. The Beginning

This journey started with a deceptively simple-looking dataset — the Kaggle Data Science & ML Survey (covering 2017–2021). At first glance, it looked like a goldmine of insights waiting to be unlocked. But as soon as we peeked under the hood, we realized we weren't just mining for insights — we'd need to do serious excavation before we could even start exploring.

**The mission was clear:**

Take this massive, messy, wide survey dataset and make it clean, consistent, and analysis-ready — while documenting every step so anyone could reproduce or audit the process later.

### 2. Meet the Data

- **Source:** Kaggle Data Science & ML Survey
- **Original Rows:** 101,846 unique entries (after removing 4,456 duplicates)
- **Original Columns:** ~300 (exact expected count before cleaning: 293)
- **Format:** Multi-choice survey → one column per option

**Challenges spotted immediately:**

- Many blank or all-null columns causing Excel/Power Query to choke
- Inconsistent column naming (mixed casing, cryptic codes like `Q1_Part_1`)
- Performance slowdowns due to extreme dataset width
- "None" / "Other" answer columns scattered throughout
- Missing survey questions Q28–Q30 in original data

### 3. The First Strategic Moves

Rather than try to clean all ~300 columns at once, we decided to split the dataset into smaller, logical files to make the work lighter and more systematic. We also wanted to group similar structures together — especially "paired" questions — so we could apply consistent transformations without fear of breaking unrelated data.

### 4. The Data Separation Plan

We ended up with 5 smaller files, each representing a theme or block of questions:

| File # | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Demographics & General Q** → Demographics + Questions 1-6 |
| 2 | **Questions 7-15** |
| 3 | **Questions 16-26** |
| 4 | **Current vs Future (Paired structure)** → Q27, Q32, Q34, Q36, Q37, Q38 — two parts each ("Current Use" and "Future Interest"), with Q28–Q30 missing from source |
| 5 | **Questions 31, 33, 35, 39, 40, 41, 42** |

**Why split like this?**

✅ Faster handling in Power Query & Excel  
✅ Easier to apply consistent cleaning rules within each block  
✅ Special handling for "paired" questions without affecting the rest

### 5. Special Handling for Paired Questions

The **Current vs Future** set (File 4) is special because each question appears in two parts, with identical answer options:

- **Part 1:** Tools/tech currently used regularly
- **Part 2:** Tools/tech the respondent wants to learn in the next 2 years

These will be kept in the same sheet, but cleaned with mirrored naming conventions (e.g., `_Now` / `_Future` suffixes). This will make later Power BI visualizations simple and accurate.

### 6. Pre-Cleaning Agreements

Before touching any values, we defined the core rules we'll follow in the cleaning phase:

- **Use a mapping table for renaming** → no manual header edits, all documented
- **Standardize data types** → match field purpose (Text, Number, Date)
- **Handle "None" & "Other"** → consistent prefixes or drop if redundant
- **Tackle missing data strategically** → distinguish between true skips and accidental blanks
- **Document everything** in a change log with the file name as the header
- **Validate final merged file** → must have exactly 293 columns after recombining

### 7. Validation Check Plan – Column Count

**Before cleaning, we will:**

1. Load original downloaded dataset → confirm column count = 293
2. If count differs, investigate before proceeding (check export completeness, hidden columns, or mismatched source)

### 8. What Happens Next

With the strategy locked, we're ready to:

1. **Clean each of the 5 files separately** using the agreed rules
2. **Keep a living change log** so the documentation tells the full story from raw → clean
3. **Merge all files back** into one master dataset
4. **Run validation** to ensure structure matches the original (but cleaner)

The next commit in this project will mark the start of the **Cleaning Phase** — where we tame the chaos and shape this into a dataset ready for powerful exploratory analysis.

# Sheet Cleaning Log — Geographic & General Questions

**Source:** Kaggle Data Science Survey (2017–2021) — Geographic & General Questions tab

---

## 1. Objective

Standardize, map, and validate key demographic and general survey fields to ensure:

- **Clarity** for dashboards and storytelling
- **Reproducibility** for future ETL runs
- **Business-friendly categories** for decision-makers

---

## 2. Actions Taken

### Geographic Fields

#### Country
- Bulk-replaced inconsistent spellings and variants via mapping table (e.g., "United States of America" → "United States")
- Corrected casing and encoding for non-Latin scripts
- Logged all original → clean replacements in ETL documentation

### Demographic & General Fields

#### Education
- Removed encoding issues and excess whitespace
- Standardized into clear academic categories:
  - High School
  - Associate degree
  - Bachelor's degree
  - Master's degree
  - Doctoral degree

#### Years Coding
- Normalized varied range formats into ordered bands:
  - `<1 year`
  - `1–2 years`
  - `3–5 years`
  - `6–9 years`
  - `10+ years`
  - `20+ years`
- Retained "20+ years" as a separate top category for experience-band analysis

#### Career Stage (derived from age ranges)
- Grouped raw age responses into consolidated stages:
  - **Junior**
  - **Mid**
  - **Senior**
  - **Expert**
- Ensured grouping rules are explicit in mapping table

#### Gender (Binary)
- Standardized values to "Male" / "Female" for binary analysis while retaining original text in reference column for inclusivity
- Removed extra spaces, fixed inconsistent casing

### Survey Meta

#### Duration (minutes)
- Converted raw completion time from seconds to minutes (rounded to two decimals)
- Flagged and filtered out extreme outliers (e.g., >180 minutes) as non-representative
- Documented null-handling policy: missing durations kept as blanks for transparency

---

## 3. Validation Steps

- ✅ Ran before/after uniques check for all categorical fields (see summary table below)
- ✅ Cross-verified that mapping tables covered 100% of pre-cleaned values
- ✅ Checked that transformed data matched expected category order for dashboard visuals

---

## 4. Before/After Unique Values — Summary

| Field | Unique Values Before Cleaning | Unique Values After Cleaning |
|-------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Country** | Mixed spellings, abbreviations, casing | Standardized title-case country names |
| **Education** | Multiple phrasings & encoding issues | 5 clean academic categories |
| **Years Coding** | Mixed symbols, text ranges, numeric values | Ordered, consistent bands |
| **Career Stage** | Age ranges in years | Grouped into 4 career stages |
| **Gender (Binary)** | Variations of male/female, mixed case | Male / Female |
| **Duration (minutes)** | Raw seconds, blanks | Rounded minutes, outliers flagged |

---

## 5. Business Impact

### ✅ Clarity
No need for last-minute manual edits before analysis

### ✅ Scalability
Mapping tables make adding new survey years effortless

### ✅ Traceability
Each transformation decision is recorded for reproducibility
