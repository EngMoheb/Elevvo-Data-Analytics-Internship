# üéµ Chinook Database Adventure: From Legacy SQLite to Business Insights

A step-by-step journey of transforming music sales data into a clean, queryable PostgreSQL database for analysis.

## üìñ The Backstory

Chinook ‚Äî a digital music store ‚Äî had years of sales data stored in a SQLite database. Our mission? Migrate it to PostgreSQL, clean it, and make it analysis-ready to answer three key business questions:

- **Top Performers** ‚Üí Which tracks generate the most revenue
- **Regional Patterns** ‚Üí Where our customers are located  
- **Trends Over Time** ‚Üí How sales evolve month-to-month

The core migration process was straightforward: We opened the SQLite database in DB Browser, exported each table to CSV, uploaded those CSVs into VS Code, connected to a PostgreSQL database, created the tables, and imported the data.

## üóÉÔ∏è The Raw Materials

We started with a single `Chinook.sqlite` database containing 11 interrelated tables:

| Table/File | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Artist | Musicians |
| Album | Collections of tracks |
| Genre | Rock, Jazz, Classical, etc. |
| MediaType | MP3, AAC, video formats |
| Track | Individual songs (products) |
| Employee | Sales team & management |
| Customer | Buyers worldwide |
| Invoice | Sales transactions |
| InvoiceLine | Items per sale |
| Playlist | Curated collections |
| PlaylistTrack | Playlist‚Äìtrack relationships |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting the Stage: Environment Setup

### Prerequisites for Success:

- PostgreSQL (any recent version)
- pgAdmin or VS Code with PostgreSQL extension
- CSV files accessible to the PostgreSQL server
- Proper permissions for file operations

### Key Configuration Note:
If CSV files use DD-MM-YY date formats, set:
```sql
SET datestyle = 'DMY';
```
before importing to avoid date parsing errors.

## üèóÔ∏è Building the Foundation: Database Schema

We designed our schema to reflect the relationships in a real music business:

- **Artists** create **Albums**
- **Albums** contain **Tracks**
- **Tracks** have **Genres** and **MediaTypes**
- **Customers** place **Invoices**
- **Invoices** contain **InvoiceLines**
- **Employees** support customers and manage sales

*(Full schema creation script is preserved for reproducibility.)*

## üöõ The Great Migration: CSV Import

With the schema ready, we bulk-imported the CSVs into PostgreSQL using `COPY`, handling date formats with `SET datestyle = 'DMY'`. This step brought all historical Chinook data into our new relational structure.

## üßπ Cleaning House: Preparing for EDA

Before analysis, we ensured the data was consistent and trustworthy:

 ```sql
/* 1) Clean Date/Time Anomalies
      - Any invoice dates outside the range 2000-01-01 to today 
        are considered invalid and set to NULL */
UPDATE "Invoice"
   SET "InvoiceDate" = NULL
 WHERE "InvoiceDate" < DATE '2000-01-01'
    OR "InvoiceDate" > CURRENT_DATE;

sql /* 2) Identify Orphaned Foreign-Key Records
      - Tracks without a linked album
      - InvoiceLines without a valid Track reference */
-- Tracks missing AlbumId
SELECT *
  FROM "Track" t
 WHERE t."AlbumId" IS NULL;

-- InvoiceLines referencing non‚Äëexistent Tracks
SELECT il.*
  FROM "InvoiceLine" il
  LEFT JOIN "Track" t ON il."TrackId" = t."TrackId"
 WHERE t."TrackId" IS NULL;

/* 3) Standardize Text Columns
      - Trim leading/trailing spaces
      - Capitalize each word in the Country field */
UPDATE "Customer"
   SET "Country" = INITCAP(TRIM("Country"));

/* 4) Validate Numeric Fields
      - Identify any UnitPrice ‚â§ 0 or Quantity ‚â§ 0 */
SELECT *
  FROM "InvoiceLine"
 WHERE "UnitPrice" <= 0
    OR "Quantity" <= 0;
```


- ‚úÖ **Valid dates** ‚Üí Removed any invoice dates far in the future or before the year 2000
- ‚úÖ **Standardized text** ‚Üí Country names cleaned and variants unified (USA, United States, U.S.A. ‚Üí USA)
- ‚úÖ **Referential integrity** ‚Üí Checked for orphaned tracks, missing invoices, or broken foreign keys
- ‚úÖ **Business rule checks** ‚Üí Flagged unit prices or quantities ‚â§ 0

We also created a data changes audit table to track every transformation for transparency and reproducibility.

## üîç The Discovery Phase: Analysis Queries

With clean data in place, we wrote targeted SQL queries to answer the business questions.

### Query 1 ‚Äî Table Inventory (Row Counts)

**Purpose:** First step in EDA ‚Äî verify table sizes and ensure expected data presence.

```sql
-- Count rows per key table in the Chinook database
SELECT 'Artist'        AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM Artist
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Album',        COUNT(*) FROM Album
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Track',        COUNT(*) FROM Track
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Genre',        COUNT(*) FROM Genre
UNION ALL
SELECT 'MediaType',    COUNT(*) FROM MediaType
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Customer',     COUNT(*) FROM Customer
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Employee',     COUNT(*) FROM Employee
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Invoice',      COUNT(*) FROM Invoice
UNION ALL
SELECT 'InvoiceLine',  COUNT(*) FROM InvoiceLine
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Playlist',     COUNT(*) FROM Playlist
UNION ALL
SELECT 'PlaylistTrack',COUNT(*) FROM PlaylistTrack;
```

**Results:**

| table_name | row_count |
|------------|-----------|
| Artist | 275 |
| Album | 347 |
| Track | 3503 |
| Genre | 25 |
| MediaType | 5 |
| Customer | 59 |
| Employee | 8 |
| Invoice | 412 |
| InvoiceLine | 2240 |
| Playlist | 18 |
| PlaylistTrack | 8715 |

### Query 2 ‚Äî Top-Selling Tracks

**Purpose:** Identify highest-revenue tracks with album & artist context.

```sql
WITH track_sales AS (
    SELECT
        il.TrackId,
        SUM(il.Quantity * il.UnitPrice) AS total_revenue, -- total $ per track
        SUM(il.Quantity)                AS units_sold     -- total units per track
    FROM InvoiceLine il
    GROUP BY il.TrackId
)
SELECT
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY ts.total_revenue DESC) AS revenue_rank,  -- rank by revenue
    ts.TrackId,
    t.Name       AS track_name,
    a.Title      AS album_title,
    ar.Name      AS artist_name,
    total_revenue::money AS total_revenue,                         -- currency format
    ts.units_sold
FROM track_sales ts
JOIN Track  t  ON ts.TrackId = t.TrackId
JOIN Album  a  ON t.AlbumId  = a.AlbumId
JOIN Artist ar ON a.ArtistId = ar.ArtistId
ORDER BY ts.total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

        SUM(il.Quantity * il.UnitPrice) AS total_revenue
    FROM Invoice inv
    JOIN InvoiceLine il ON inv.InvoiceId = il.InvoiceId
    GROUP BY INITCAP(TRIM(BillingCountry))
)
SELECT 
    country,
    total_revenue::money AS total_revenue,                                      -- currency
    ROUND(total_revenue * 100.0 / SUM(total_revenue) OVER (), 2)::text || '%' AS pct_of_total -- percentage
FROM revenue_by_country
