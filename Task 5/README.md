üéµ Chinook Database Adventure: From Legacy SQLite to Business Insights
A step‚Äëby‚Äëstep journey of transforming music sales data into a clean, queryable PostgreSQL database for analysis.

1. The Backstory
Chinook ‚Äî a digital music store ‚Äî had years of sales data stored in a SQLite database. Our mission? Migrate it to PostgreSQL, clean it, and make it analysis‚Äëready to answer three key business questions:

Top Performers ‚Üí Which tracks generate the most revenue

Regional Patterns ‚Üí Where our customers are located

Trends Over Time ‚Üí How sales evolve month‚Äëto‚Äëmonth

The core migration process was straightforward: We opened the SQLite database in DB Browser, exported each table to CSV, uploaded those CSVs into VS Code, connected to a PostgreSQL database, created the tables, and imported the data.

2. The Raw Materials
We started with a single Chinook.sqlite database containing 11 interrelated tables:

Table/File	Description
Artist	Musicians
Album	Collections of tracks
Genre	Rock, Jazz, Classical, etc.
MediaType	MP3, AAC, video formats
Track	Individual songs (products)
Employee	Sales team & management
Customer	Buyers worldwide
Invoice	Sales transactions
InvoiceLine	Items per sale
Playlist	Curated collections
PlaylistTrack	Playlist‚Äìtrack relationships
‚öôÔ∏è 3. Setting the Stage: Environment Setup
Prerequisites for Success:

PostgreSQL (any recent version)

pgAdmin or VS Code with PostgreSQL extension

CSV files accessible to the PostgreSQL server

Proper permissions for file operations

Key Configuration Note: If CSV files use DD-MM-YY date formats, set:

sql
SET datestyle = 'DMY';
before importing to avoid date parsing errors.

üèóÔ∏è 4. Building the Foundation: Database Schema
We designed our schema to reflect the relationships in a real music business:

Artists create Albums

Albums contain Tracks

Tracks have Genres and MediaTypes

Customers place Invoices

Invoices contain InvoiceLines

Employees support customers and manage sales

(Full schema creation script from your original work is preserved for reproducibility.)

üöõ 5. The Great Migration: CSV Import
With the schema ready, we bulk‚Äëimported the CSVs into PostgreSQL using COPY, handling date formats with SET datestyle = 'DMY'. This step brought all historical Chinook data into our new relational structure.

üßπ 6. Cleaning House: Preparing for EDA
Before analysis, we ensured the data was consistent and trustworthy:

Valid dates ‚Üí Removed any invoice dates far in the future or before the year 2000

Standardized text ‚Üí Country names cleaned and variants unified (USA, United States, U.S.A. ‚Üí USA)

Referential integrity ‚Üí Checked for orphaned tracks, missing invoices, or broken foreign keys

Business rule checks ‚Üí Flagged unit prices or quantities ‚â§ 0

We also created a data changes audit table to track every transformation for transparency and reproducibility.

üîç 7. The Discovery Phase: Analysis Queries
With clean data in place, we wrote targeted SQL queries to answer the business questions.

Query 1 ‚Äî Top-Selling Tracks
sql
WITH track_sales AS (
  SELECT
    il."TrackId",
    SUM(il."Quantity" * il."UnitPrice") AS total_revenue,
    SUM(il."Quantity")                 AS units_sold
  FROM "InvoiceLine" il
  GROUP BY il."TrackId"
)
SELECT
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY ts.total_revenue DESC) AS revenue_rank,
  ts."TrackId",
  t."Name"      AS track_name,
  a."Title"     AS album_title,
  ar."Name"     AS artist_name,
  ts.total_revenue,
  ts.units_sold
FROM track_sales ts
JOIN "Track"   t  ON ts."TrackId" = t."TrackId"
LEFT JOIN "Album"   a  ON t."AlbumId"   = a."AlbumId"
LEFT JOIN "Artist"  ar ON a."ArtistId"  = ar."ArtistId"
ORDER BY ts.total_revenue DESC, ts.units_sold DESC
LIMIT 10;
Result Snip:

Rank	Track Name	Album	Artist	Revenue	Units
1	How to Stop an Exploding Man	Heroes, Season 1	Heroes	3.98	2
1	The Woman King	Battlestar Galactica S3	Battlestar Galactica	3.98	2
1	Walkabout	Lost, Season 1	Lost	3.98	2
Query 2 ‚Äî Revenue by Country
sql
WITH revenue_by_country AS (
  SELECT
    TRIM("Country") AS country,
    SUM(il."Quantity" * il."UnitPrice") AS total_revenue
  FROM "Invoice" inv
  JOIN "InvoiceLine" il ON inv."InvoiceId" = il."InvoiceId"
  JOIN "Customer" c ON inv."CustomerId" = c."CustomerId"
  GROUP BY TRIM("Country")
)
SELECT
  country,
  total_revenue,
  ROUND(total_revenue * 100.0 / SUM(total_revenue) OVER (), 2) AS pct_of_total
FROM revenue_by_country
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
Result Snip:

Country	Revenue	% of Total
USA	523.06	22.46
Canada	303.96	13.05
France	195.10	8.38
Brazil	190.10	8.16
Query 3 ‚Äî Monthly Revenue Trends
sql
WITH monthly_sales AS (
  SELECT
    TO_CHAR(inv."InvoiceDate", 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
    SUM(il."Quantity" * il."UnitPrice")   AS revenue
  FROM "Invoice" inv
  JOIN "InvoiceLine" il ON inv."InvoiceId" = il."InvoiceId"
  GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT
  month,
  revenue,
  SUM(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY month) AS running_total
FROM monthly_sales
ORDER BY month;
Result Snip:

Month	Revenue	Running Total
2009-01	37.62	37.62
2009-02	37.62	75.24
2009-03	37.62	112.86
...	...	...
2010-01	52.62	(higher)
