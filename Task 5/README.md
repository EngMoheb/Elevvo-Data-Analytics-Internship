# üéµ Chinook Database Adventure: From Raw CSV to Business Insights

*A complete journey through SQL-based analysis of music sales data*

---

## üìñ The Story Behind This Project

Imagine you're a data analyst for a digital music store called Chinook. The company has been collecting sales data for years, but it's scattered across multiple CSV files, inconsistent, and difficult to analyze. Your mission? Transform this chaotic data into a clean, queryable PostgreSQL database that can answer critical business questions.

This is the story of **Task 5** - how we turned messy music sales data into actionable insights about top-selling tracks, regional performance, and sales trends.

## üéØ The Mission: Goals & Objectives

Our stakeholders came to us with three burning business questions:

1. **"Which tracks are our money-makers?"** - Identify top-selling products by revenue
2. **"Where are our customers?"** - Analyze revenue distribution by geographic region  
3. **"How are we trending?"** - Track monthly sales performance over time

**Success Criteria:**
- Clean, reproducible SQL scripts from raw data to insights
- Well-documented process that any team member can follow
- Actionable business intelligence ready for decision-making

## üìä The Raw Materials: Dataset Overview

We started with 11 CSV files exported from the legacy Chinook system, scattered across a Windows directory structure:

```
D:/Interns/Elevvo/Task 5/CSV/
‚îú‚îÄ Artist.csv        (The musicians behind the music)
‚îú‚îÄ Album.csv         (Collections of tracks)
‚îú‚îÄ Genre.csv         (Rock, Jazz, Classical, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ MediaType.csv     (MP3, AAC, video formats)
‚îú‚îÄ Track.csv         (Individual songs - our products)
‚îú‚îÄ Employee.csv      (Sales team and management)
‚îú‚îÄ Customer.csv      (Our buyers worldwide)
‚îú‚îÄ Invoice.csv       (Sale transactions)
‚îú‚îÄ InvoiceLine.csv   (Individual items per sale)
‚îú‚îÄ Playlist.csv      (Curated collections)
‚îî‚îÄ PlaylistTrack.csv (Many-to-many relationships)
```

**The Challenge:** These files were disconnected, contained inconsistent formatting, and had potential data quality issues that needed investigation.

**Our Organized Approach:**
```
task-5/
‚îú‚îÄ create_tables.sql     (Schema definition)
‚îú‚îÄ import_csvs.sql       (Data loading scripts)
‚îú‚îÄ cleaning.sql          (Quality assurance)
‚îú‚îÄ analysis_queries.sql  (Business intelligence)
‚îú‚îÄ README.md            (This story)
‚îî‚îÄ data/
   ‚îú‚îÄ raw/              (Original CSVs)
   ‚îî‚îÄ clean/            (Processed data)
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting the Stage: Environment Setup

**Prerequisites for Success:**
- PostgreSQL (any recent version)
- pgAdmin or VS Code with PostgreSQL extension
- CSV files accessible to the PostgreSQL server
- Proper permissions for file operations

**Key Configuration Note:** 
If your CSV files use DD-MM-YY date formats (common in international exports), we'll need to set `datestyle = 'DMY'` before importing to avoid date parsing errors.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Building the Foundation: Database Schema

Like constructing a building, we started with a solid foundation. Our database schema reflects the real relationships in a music business:

### The Architecture Story

1. **Artists** create **Albums**
2. **Albums** contain **Tracks** (our products)
3. **Tracks** have **Genres** and **MediaTypes**
4. **Customers** place **Invoices**
5. **Invoices** contain **InvoiceLines** (individual track purchases)
6. **Employees** support customers and manage sales

### Complete Schema Creation

## üöõ The Great Migration: CSV Import

With our foundation built, it was time for the great data migration. This is where theory meets reality - importing real-world data with all its quirks and challenges.

### Import Strategy

We used PostgreSQL's powerful `COPY` command for bulk loading, but first needed to handle the date format challenge:

```sql
-- Critical first step: Handle international date formats
SET datestyle = 'DMY';

-- Now we can safely import all tables
COPY "Artist"("ArtistId","Name")
FROM 'D:/Interns/Elevvo/Task 5/CSV/Artist.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

COPY "Album"("AlbumId","Title","ArtistId")
FROM 'D:/Interns/Elevvo/Task 5/CSV/Album.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

COPY "Genre"("GenreId","Name")
FROM 'D:/Interns/Elevvo/Task 5/CSV/Genre.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

COPY "MediaType"("MediaTypeId","Name")
FROM 'D:/Interns/Elevvo/Task 5/CSV/MediaType.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

COPY "Track"("TrackId","Name","AlbumId","MediaTypeId","GenreId","Composer","Milliseconds","Bytes","UnitPrice")
FROM 'D:/Interns/Elevvo/Task 5/CSV/Track.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

COPY "Employee"("EmployeeId","LastName","FirstName","Title","ReportsTo","BirthDate","HireDate","Address","City","State","Country","PostalCode","Phone","Fax","Email")
FROM 'D:/Interns/Elevvo/Task 5/CSV/Employee.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

COPY "Customer"("CustomerId","FirstName","LastName","Company","Address","City","State","Country","PostalCode","Phone","Fax","Email","SupportRepId")
FROM 'D:/Interns/Elevvo/Task 5/CSV/Customer.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

COPY "Invoice"("InvoiceId","CustomerId","InvoiceDate","BillingAddress","BillingCity","BillingState","BillingCountry","BillingPostalCode","Total")
FROM 'D:/Interns/Elevvo/Task 5/CSV/Invoice.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

COPY "InvoiceLine"("InvoiceLineId","InvoiceId","TrackId","UnitPrice","Quantity")
FROM 'D:/Interns/Elevvo/Task 5/CSV/InvoiceLine.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

COPY "Playlist"("PlaylistId","Name")
FROM 'D:/Interns/Elevvo/Task 5/CSV/Playlist.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

COPY "PlaylistTrack"("PlaylistId","TrackId")
FROM 'D:/Interns/Elevvo/Task 5/CSV/PlaylistTrack.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```

### Common Migration Challenges We Solved

**Challenge 1: Date Format Mismatches**
- **Problem:** CSV exports often use DD-MM-YY format
- **Solution:** Set `datestyle = 'DMY'` before importing

**Challenge 2: Permission Denied Errors**
- **Problem:** PostgreSQL server can't access the file path
- **Solution:** Move files to server-accessible directory or use pgAdmin GUI import

**Challenge 3: Encoding Issues**
- **Problem:** Special characters not displaying correctly
- **Solution:** Add `ENCODING 'UTF8'` to COPY commands when needed

## üßπ Cleaning House: Data Preparation

Raw data is rarely perfect. Like preparing ingredients before cooking, we needed to clean and standardize our data before analysis.

### Our Data Quality Checklist

#### 1. Date Validation & Cleanup
```sql
-- Remove obviously invalid dates (future dates, ancient dates)
UPDATE "Invoice"
   SET "InvoiceDate" = NULL
 WHERE "InvoiceDate" < '2000-01-01' OR "InvoiceDate" > CURRENT_DATE;
```

#### 2. Text Standardization
```sql
-- Standardize country names - critical for geographic analysis
UPDATE "Customer"
   SET "Country" = INITCAP(TRIM("Country"))
 WHERE TRIM("Country") IS NOT NULL;

-- Handle common country variants
UPDATE "Customer"
   SET "Country" = 'USA'
 WHERE UPPER(TRIM("Country")) IN ('USA','US','UNITED STATES','U.S.A.');
```

#### 3. Referential Integrity Checks
```sql
-- Find orphaned tracks (missing album references)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS orphan_tracks 
FROM "Track" 
WHERE "AlbumId" IS NULL;

-- Identify invoice lines pointing to non-existent tracks
SELECT il.* 
FROM "InvoiceLine" il
LEFT JOIN "Track" t ON il."TrackId" = t."TrackId"
WHERE t."TrackId" IS NULL;

-- Check for invoice lines without corresponding invoices
SELECT il.* 
FROM "InvoiceLine" il
LEFT JOIN "Invoice" inv ON il."InvoiceId" = inv."InvoiceId"
WHERE inv."InvoiceId" IS NULL;
```

#### 4. Business Logic Validation
```sql
-- Identify problematic pricing or quantities
SELECT * 
FROM "InvoiceLine" 
WHERE "UnitPrice" <= 0 OR "Quantity" <= 0;
```

### Data Quality Documentation

For traceability, we created an audit trail:

```sql
-- Track all data changes
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS task5_data_changes (
  change_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  changed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
  table_name TEXT,
  pk_value TEXT,
  change_type TEXT, -- e.g. 'NULLIFIED_DATE', 'MAPPED_COUNTRY'
  details TEXT,
  applied_by TEXT
);
```

## üîç The Discovery Phase: Analysis Queries

With clean data in hand, we could finally answer our business questions. Each query tells part of the Chinook story.

### Query 1: The Chart-Toppers (Top-Selling Tracks)

**Business Question:** "Which tracks generate the most revenue?"

```sql
-- Top-selling tracks: revenue leaders with detailed context
WITH track_sales AS (
  SELECT
    il."TrackId",
    SUM(il."Quantity" * il."UnitPrice") AS total_revenue,
    SUM(il."Quantity")                 AS units_sold
  FROM "InvoiceLine" il
  GROUP BY il."TrackId"
)
SELECT
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY ts.total_revenue DESC) AS revenue_rank,
  ts."TrackId",
  t."Name"      AS track_name,
  a."Title"     AS album_title,
  ar."Name"     AS artist_name,
  ts.total_revenue,
  ts.units_sold
FROM track_sales ts
JOIN "Track"   t  ON ts."TrackId" = t."TrackId"
LEFT JOIN "Album"   a  ON t."AlbumId"   = a."AlbumId"
LEFT JOIN "Artist"  ar ON a."ArtistId"  = ar."ArtistId"
ORDER BY ts.total_revenue DESC, ts.units_sold DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Why This Query Works:**
- Uses CTE for clear separation of calculation logic
- LEFT JOINs prevent data loss if metadata is missing
- Ranking function handles ties appropriately
- Multiple sort criteria provide consistent ordering

### Query 2: Global Revenue Map (Revenue by Region)

**Business Question:** "Where are our customers and how much do they spend?"

```sql
-- Revenue by country with percentage breakdown
WITH revenue_by_country AS (
  SELECT
    TRIM("Country") AS country,
    SUM(il."Quantity" * il."UnitPrice") AS total_revenue
  FROM "Invoice" inv
  JOIN "InvoiceLine" il ON inv."InvoiceId" = il."InvoiceId"
  JOIN "Customer" c ON inv."CustomerId" = c."CustomerId"
  GROUP BY TRIM("Country")
)
SELECT
  country,
  total_revenue,
  ROUND(total_revenue * 100.0 / SUM(total_revenue) OVER (), 2) AS pct_of_total
FROM revenue_by_country
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

**Key Features:**
- Window function calculates percentage of total revenue
- TRIM() handles whitespace inconsistencies
- Results show market concentration and expansion opportunities

### Query 3: The Pulse Check (Monthly Sales Trends)

**Business Question:** "How are our sales trending over time?"

```sql
-- Monthly revenue trends with running totals
WITH monthly_sales AS (
  SELECT
    TO_CHAR(inv."InvoiceDate", 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
    SUM(il."Quantity" * il."UnitPrice")   AS revenue
  FROM "Invoice" inv
  JOIN "InvoiceLine" il ON inv."InvoiceId" = il."InvoiceId"
  GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT
  month,
  revenue,
  SUM(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY month) AS running_total
FROM monthly_sales
ORDER BY month;
```

**Analytical Power:**
- Time series format perfect for trend analysis
- Running total shows cumulative business growth
- Easy to extend with moving averages or seasonal analysis

## üéâ Eureka Moments: Key Findings

Our analysis revealed fascinating patterns in the Chinook music business:

### Discovery 1: The Power of TV Shows
**The Surprising Winner:** TV show episodes dominated our top-selling list!

| Rank | Track Name | Album | Artist | Revenue | Units |
|------|------------|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| 1 | How to Stop an Exploding Man | Heroes, Season 1 | Heroes | $3.98 | 2 |
| 1 | The Woman King | Battlestar Galactica, Season 3 | Battlestar Galactica | $3.98 | 2 |
| 1 | Walkabout | Lost, Season 1 | Lost | $3.98 | 2 |

**Business Insight:** Digital video content, not music, drives our highest per-unit revenue. This suggests an opportunity to expand our video catalog or adjust pricing strategies for music content.

### Discovery 2: The American Market Dominance
**Geographic Revenue Distribution:**

| Country | Revenue | % of Total |
|---------|---------|------------|
| USA | $523.06 | 22.46% |
| Canada | $303.96 | 13.05% |
| France | $195.10 | 8.38% |
| Brazil | $190.10 | 8.16% |

**Business Insight:** North America represents 35% of total revenue, showing strong market penetration. However, the global distribution suggests untapped potential in underserved regions.

### Discovery 3: Consistent but Curious Sales Patterns
**Monthly Revenue Pattern:**
- Many months showed identical revenue figures ($37.62)
- Occasional spikes (like January 2010: $52.62) warrant investigation
- Pattern suggests either very consistent customer behavior or data collection artifacts

**Business Insight:** The regularity might indicate subscription-based revenue or need for data validation. Spikes could represent successful promotions worth replicating.

## ‚ö° Performance Tuning: Optimization Notes

### Index Strategy Success
Our strategic indexing paid dividends:
- **Foreign key indexes** accelerated JOIN operations
- **Customer and Invoice indexes** sped up revenue calculations
- **Track-related indexes** improved product analysis queries

### Scaling Recommendations
For larger datasets, consider:

```sql
-- Temporarily disable indexes for bulk operations
DROP INDEX idx_invoiceline_invoiceid;
-- Perform bulk insert/update
-- Recreate index
CREATE INDEX idx_invoiceline_invoiceid ON "InvoiceLine" ("InvoiceId");
```

### Query Performance Tips
1. **Use CTEs** for complex calculations - improves readability and often performance
2. **LEFT JOINs** when dealing with potentially missing reference data
3. **Window functions** for analytical calculations are more efficient than subqueries
4. **LIMIT results** during development to avoid unnecessary data transfer
