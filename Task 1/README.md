## Story

Imagine you're handed thousands of messy sales transactions and asked to turn them into a single, reliable story executives can act on. That's the mission we completed: clean the Superstore data, enrich it with helper fields, analyze revenue and volume trends, and deliver a live, interactive Excel dashboard that answers the core questions:

> *Where are we making money? When do sales spike? How fast is revenue moving month-to-month and year-to-year?*

## Problem & Dataset Story
![Task brief](Task%20Details.png)

**Dataset:** [Superstore Sales dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting)  

![Raw data preview](OriginalData.png)

**Excel sheet used:** [RawData.xlsx](RawData.xlsx)

The raw data captured orders across regions, categories and years. It required cleaning and enrichment before we could rely on trends and growth metrics.

## Data Cleaning Journey

> Cleaning was the foundation, not an afterthought.

![Cleaned data snapshot](DataCleaned.png)

**Cleaned dataset saved as:** [CleanedData.xlsx](CleanedData.xlsx)

### Transformation Steps

1. **Data Import**  
   - Imported `RawData.xlsx` into Excel as an official **Table** named `tblSales`.

2. **Type & Value Validation**  
   - Formatted `Sales` as *Currency* and flagged negative/zero entries.  
   - Ensured `Order Date` and `Ship Date` are true Excel dates (converted text‚Üídate where needed).

3. **Text Normalization**  
   - Applied `=PROPER(TRIM(...))` to Region, Category, Product and Customer names to standardize labels.

4. **ID & Postal Checks**  
   - Implemented simple formula checks to validate formats of `Order ID`, `Customer ID`, `Product ID`.  
   - Replaced blank postal codes with `Unknown`.

5. **Missing Value Management**  
   - Flagged critical gaps and reviewed them; corrected or excluded rows as appropriate.

## Helper Columns

We added helper columns to enhance our analysis capabilities and ensure reliable pivot table operations. These columns transform the raw data into an analysis-ready format.

### Essential Helper Columns for Analysis:

- **Units Sold** ‚Äî Sets each transaction line to `1` for reliable item counting in pivot tables, enabling accurate volume analysis alongside revenue trends.

- **OrderDate** ‚Äî Converts all date entries to proper Excel date serials, ensuring date functions (YEAR, MONTH, TEXT) work correctly for time-based analysis.

- **Order Year** ‚Äî Extracts integer years (2015, 2016, etc.) for quick year-over-year comparisons and annual trend analysis in pivot tables.

- **Order Month** ‚Äî Creates readable month labels ("Jan", "Feb", etc.) for seasonal analysis and dashboard display.

- **Month Num** ‚Äî Provides numeric months (1‚Äì12) to enable proper chronological sorting in pivot tables (preventing alphabetical month ordering).

- **Year‚ÄìMonth** ‚Äî Combines year and month into a single timeline code (`yyyy-mm`) for seamless time series analysis and month-over-month calculations.
