# Elevvo Internship Repository

Welcome to the **Elevvo Internship Repository**. This repo contains all tasks and learning materials from my one-month fully-sponsored remote data analytics internship at Elevvo (Cairo).

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives of Task 1 (Excel Sales Dashboard)

### 1. Ingest & Clean Data

- Import the Superstore Sales dataset into Excel as a table (`tblSales`).
- Validate data types (numeric, currency, date, text) and replace invalid or missing values.
- Create helper columns: Units Sold, OrderDate_Real, Order Year, Order Month, Month Num, Yearâ€“Month.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Build summary PivotTables to calculate total revenue and units sold by time, region, and category.
- Identify trends, seasonality, and outliers in sales performance.

### 3. Dashboard Development

- Construct interactive charts (line charts, KPI cards) to visualize monthly revenue, units sold, MoM%, and YoY%.
- Add slicers for Region and Category to enable dynamic filtering.

### 4. Insights & Reporting

- Document key findings in narrative form and annotate charts with business insights.
- Consolidate all elements into a polished `Dashboard_Excel` sheet.

## Dataset

- **Name:** Superstore Sales Dataset (Kaggle)
- **File:** `data/raw/Superstore.csv`
- **Description:** Sales transaction records including Order ID, Customer ID, Product ID, Sales amount, Order and Ship dates, and address data.

## Data Cleaning

### 1. Load Data

- Converted raw CSV into an Excel Table named `tblSales`.

### 2. Numeric & Currency Validation

- Ensured `Row ID` uniqueness with `=COUNTIF(..)=1`.
- Formatted `Sales` as currency; flagged zero or negative values.

### 3. Date Normalization

- Parsed Order/Ship dates into serial values using `DATEVALUE` or `DATE(...)` formulas.
- Created `OrderDate_Real` helper for reliable YEAR/MONTH functions.

### 4. Text Standardization & Validation

- Used `=PROPER(TRIM(...))` for fields like Region, Category, Customer Name.
- Validated `Order ID`, `Customer ID`, and `Product ID` formats via structured-reference formulas with `LEN`, `MID`, and `ISNUMBER`.

### 5. Helper Columns

- `Units Sold` = 1 (for counting items).
- `Order Year` = `YEAR([@[OrderDate_Real]])`.
- `Order Month` = `TEXT([@[OrderDate_Real]],"mmm")`.
- `Month Num` = `MONTH([@[OrderDate_Real]])`.
- `Yearâ€“Month` = `TEXT([@[OrderDate_Real]],"yyyy-mm")`.

## EDA

### 1. Summary PivotTable

- Rows: Yearâ€“Month
- Values: Sum of `Sales` (Total Revenue), Sum of `Units Sold`.

### 2. Trend Analysis

- Created line charts for revenue and units sold over time.
- Applied slicers for dynamic filtering by Region and Category.

### 3. Growth Metrics

- Added **MoM %** via Pivot's **Show Values As â–º % Difference From (previous)** on Yearâ€“Month.
- Added **YoY %** via **Show Values As â–º % Difference From (previous)** on Order Year.

## Dashboard Development

- **Sheet:** `Dashboard_Excel`
- **Components:**
  - **Summary Table:** Total Revenue & Units Sold by Yearâ€“Month.
  - **Trend Charts:** Line charts for Revenue Over Time and Units Sold Over Time.
  - **KPI Cards:** Average, Min, Max MoM % values linked via formulas.
  - **YoY Pivot:** Yearly Total Revenue with YoY % column.
  - **Slicers:** Region, Category for synchronized filtering.
  - **Annotations:** Text boxes highlighting key insights.

## Key Findings

- **Peak Revenue:** Nov 2018 at $118,000 (+20.3% YoY).
- **Lowest Revenue:** Feb 2015 at $4,500 (â€“75.1% MoM).
- **Average MoM Growth:** +44.1%.
- **Biggest MoM Spike:** +1,121.4% (Mar 2015).
- **Units Sold** trends align with revenue, showing seasonal dips in Q1.

## Conclusion & Lessons Learned

- **Data Quality Matters:** Early cleaning and validation prevents downstream errors.
- **Excel as BI Tool:** PivotTables, charts, and slicers enable powerful analyses without code.
- **Time-Based Metrics:** Helper columns unlocked dynamic MoM and YoY insights.
- **Business Insights:** Identified critical months for promotions and inventory planning.
