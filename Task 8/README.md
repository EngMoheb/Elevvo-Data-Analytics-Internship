# Superstore Sales Analytics: A Power BI Deep Dive üìä

*Transforming raw sales data into actionable business insights through interactive visualizations*

## üéØ Executive Summary

What started as a messy Superstore dataset has become a powerful analytical dashboard that reveals the hidden patterns driving **$2,261,537** in revenue. Through three carefully crafted visualizations, we've uncovered critical insights: Consumers dominate our revenue stream, shipping preferences reveal untapped pricing opportunities, and our product portfolio analysis now uses robust median calculations after fixing a critical DAX error that corrected our average price per unit to **$230.77**.

This README chronicles our analytical journey from data cleaning to dashboard creation, documenting every decision, fix, and discovery along the way.

## üìà The Data Story

### Dataset Origins & Preparation
Our adventure began with the ubiquitous **Superstore Sales dataset** from Kaggle‚Äîa retail goldmine spanning **2015-2018** that captures the essence of modern e-commerce operations. After thorough cleaning in Task 1 (Excel), we imported this treasure trove into Power BI as `tblSales`, ready to unlock its secrets.

**Key Data Assets:**
- **Temporal Scope:** 4 years of order history (2015-2018)
- **Core Entities:** Orders, Customers, Products spanning multiple segments and categories  
- **Critical Dimensions:** `SegmentClean`, `Category`, `Sub-Category`, `StateClean`, `ShipModeClean`
- **Key Metrics:** `Sales`, `Unit Sold`, `Ship Delay (Days)`

**Data Integrity Measures:**
- Raw query `tblSales_Raw` preserved with Load disabled for audit trail
- Validation flags maintained in queries but hidden from report interface
- Full numeric precision maintained for all canonical aggregates

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note:** Early visualizations displayed ~$2,000,000 due to decimal formatting settings. The **canonical total revenue is $2,261,537**‚Äîevery dollar matters in our analysis.

### Visual 1: Customer Segment Deep-Dive 
*"Who are our customers, and what drives their purchasing behavior?"*

**The Discovery:** A elegant donut chart paired with a detailed matrix revealed the true power dynamics of our customer base.

**Revenue Breakdown (Total: $2,261,537):**

| Segment | Revenue | Percentage | Units | AOV | Customers |
|---------|---------|------------|-------|-----|-----------|
| **Consumer** | **$1,148,061** | **50.76%** | 5,101 | $452.53 | 409 |
| **Corporate** | **$688,494** | **30.44%** | 2,953 | $461.77 | 236 |
| **Home Office** | **$424,982** | **18.79%** | 1,746 | $475.37 | 148 |

**Product Champions by Revenue:**
1. **Phones** - $327,782
2. **Chairs** - $322,823  
3. **Storage** - $219,343
4. **Tables** - $202,811
5. **Binders** - $200,029

**üí° Strategic Insight:** Consumer segment dominance combined with Home Office's highest AOV ($475.37) suggests a dual-strategy opportunity: mass-market Consumer promotions for Phones & Chairs, plus premium bundling for high-value Home Office customers.

### Visual 2: Shipping Mode Intelligence
*"How do shipping preferences reveal hidden revenue opportunities?"*

**The Challenge:** Understanding the intricate relationship between customer segments and shipping choices required careful visualization design to avoid misleading interpretations.

**Shipping Revenue Matrix:**

| Ship Mode | Total Revenue | Consumer | Corporate | Home Office |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Standard Class** | **$1,340,831** | $702,378 | $401,747 | $236,706 |
| **Second Class** | **$449,914** | $230,126 | $139,045 | $80,743 |
| **First Class** | **$345,572** | $158,105 | $102,580 | $84,887 |
| **Same Day** | **$125,218** | $57,452 | $45,121 | $22,645 |

**üéØ Critical Business Insight:** Corporate customers demonstrate premium shipping behavior with Same Day orders averaging **$777.95 AOV**‚Äîsignificantly higher than other segments. This presents a golden opportunity for:
- Premium shipping pricing strategies
- Negotiated carrier rate optimization
- Targeted express shipping promotions

**Visualization Challenge Solved:** We identified that 100% stacked charts normalize each shipping mode to 100%, showing "share of that ship mode" rather than "share of segment." This initially created percentage anomalies that could mislead stakeholders.

**Solution Options Documented:**
1. Add percentages in tooltips (quick fix)
2. Switch to absolute stacked columns (clarity-focused)
3. Implement combo chart with percent-of-segment line (comprehensive solution)

### Visual 3: Product Portfolio Scatter Analysis
*"What does our product pricing landscape really look like?"*

**The Plot Twist:** Our initial analysis hit a roadblock when a DAX calculation error skewed our price per unit calculations. This led to a crucial methodological decision that strengthened our entire analytical framework.

**The Fix:** We pivoted from mean to **Median Price per Unit**‚Äîa robust statistical approach that eliminates outlier distortion and provides more reliable insights for business decision-making.

**Corrected Metrics:**
- **Average Price per Unit:** $230.77 (post-DAX correction)
- **Methodology:** Median-based calculations for outlier resistance
- **Impact:** More reliable product positioning insights

**Why Median Matters:** In retail analytics, extreme price points can skew averages dramatically. Our median approach ensures that a few high-priced specialty items don't distort the overall pricing narrative, leading to more actionable strategic insights.
